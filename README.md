A multiplayer Racer with a level editor

This thing is awesome.

It is a multiplayer Racing game in which you design a level, create a room with it selected, and anyone else can join that game. It will download your level to their game, and you can race together.
You can place objects, props, procedural roads, and start/finish lines with checkpoints.

I suggest making your own basic level first as the default level's lighting is broken now.

You can also choose from 3 original car models to race in.

WASD to drive, editor works like any other basic 3D modeler. XBox controller also supported IIRC.
